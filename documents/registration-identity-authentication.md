# Registry Identity and Authentication

This document details the technical implementation of identity and authentication for the registry. We detail the roles, privileges and the permissions required to access data in the registry. The goal of this document is to propose standard roles and privileges associated with API end points to ensure registry interoperability using standardized queries and responses.

## Identity / Login method

Users will log into the registry using a number of methods: it could be using their phone, email or corporate identity. Conceptually, they will verify their identity using these methods and get encrypted tokens back with the appropriate scopes (JavaScript Web Tokens for this document). The credentials are decoded / de-encrypted on the registry server and depending on the scopes present and the API called relevant the data is sent back as a standard HTTP responses. In the case of a "non-federated" / singular registry the flow looks like the diagram below.

For a broader application of querying multiple registries (registry broker) and how this ties into the ICAO Trust Framework, please review the intergration section in the [broker whitepaper](https://github.com/openskies-sh/aircraftregistry-broker/blob/master/documents/registration-brokerage-specification.md#integration-with-icao-trust-framework).

## Comment

Security is a vast and deep topic, for the purpose of this document, we are not advocating a specific security mechanism or technology. As the security landscape evolves, there is need to be flexible, at this time, it is unclear which security technology or mechanism is the most suitable for unmanned aviation. In the community there is a debate about whether OAUTH that powers major internet sites is good enough or "aviation grade". It is clear that security in aviation is a open topic that needs more research and more importantly testing.

However, it is the opinion of the author that being stuck in the technology mechanism prevents us from moving forward. We are more interested in developing the API, the scopes, identities and  roles and permissions and assume that any current or future technology can be used to communicate and transmit this information. For the sake of performance testing, we are using Auth0.com a commercial service and also have built our own OAUTH compatible Identity and Authentication Server: [Flight Passport](https://www.github.com/openskies-sh/flight_passport)


## Registry tables and Scopes

The registry backend specifies a set of [tables](https://github.com/openskies-sh/aircraftregistry/blob/master/registry/models.py) for a database to hold data about the People, Operators and Equipment. However, in the API the data in these tables is aggregated and we have endpoint based scopes.

- `privileged` scopes are for privileged endpoints and interested parties.
- `unthrottled` scopes are for specific endpoints and roles (see below).

| Table |  Notes |
| --- |  --- |
| Person |   All information about a person, it could be a contact, pilot etc. PII Information is in this capacity |
| Address |  All information about addresses, PII information  |
| Activity |   All information about activities undertaken by a operator |
| Authorization | All information about authorization for the operator |
| Operator  |  All information related to a operators in the registry|
| Contact |  All information about a contact. PII Information. |
| Test  | All information about tests taken by the pilot |
| Pilot |  All information about the pilot, PII Information |
| TestValidity |  Write information about TestValidity|
| TypeCertificate  |  All information about aircraft type certificate |
| Manufacturer | All information about manufacturers |
| Aircraft  |  All information about drones and aircraft in the registry |

## Digital Identity Risk Assessment

**to be completed** 

In the context of Digital Identity we use the following definitions:

 - IAL refers to the identity proofing process.
 - AAL refers to the authentication process.
 - FAL refers to the strength of an assertion in a federated environment, used to communicate authentication and attribute information (if applicable) to a relying party (RP).

## Information Security Assessment

The registry by its nature will store personally identifiable information (PII) and the database will come under the local or national privacy and data protection laws. In many cases, this means that the data has to be stored in different servers and / or relevant security and isolation procedures must be followed. At a API level however, we propose different privileges, roles and scope that enable the interested party making the query to access this information.

For the purpose of testing the registry, we have reviewed two specific documents / publications from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). [1][2][3]

## Rate limits

In the [API Specification](https://aircraftregistry.herokuapp.com/api/v1/), we have a section for rate limits for queries arising out of the registries. We acknowledge that rate limits is a vast topic in itself and for certain types of users (e.g. law enforcement), rate limits may need to be disabled. This is a decision that needs to be taken at the implementation level to ensure that the throttling is turned off. The section below makes note of such exception (see Notes column)

## Payload and scopes

In this section we will describe the payload that will be used to query the registry. Below is a decrypted JWT token (sent as a Bearer Token with the request) to demonstrate the details of the token. Here the `scope` is the most important parameter since it details the privileges allocated to the role. For more information please see [Flight Passport](https://www.github.com/openskiesh-sh/flight-passport).

``` JSON
{
  "iss": "https://id.openskies.sh/",
  "sub": "auth0|823f58f0ad39c506",
  "aud": [
    "https://openskies.sh/registration",
  ],
  "iat": 8644995913,
  "exp": 7333345260,
  "azp": "hnhxSbRihoaBXOsLcgy2nbIIEIZNt01U",
  "scope": "registry.read.operator registry.read.operator.privileged openid profile",
  "permissions": []
}

```

The goal here is to demonstrate how the JWT token encapsulates the role and scopes associated with the login. Once these scopes are passed to the registry then the appropriate response is received.

## API End point scopes

The list below details the registry endpoints as depicted in the API blue print and the associated scopes with it.

## Roles

Below are roles listed as they are developed in the registry. In the coming time, more roles will be developed as per individual and professional roles in the different organizations mentioned in the [Interested Parties](https://github.com/openskies-sh/aircraftregistry/blob/master/documents/registration-white-paper.md#interested-parties) section. These roles and scopes would have to be linked to the registry and provided via the authentication system. We have linked the role to the appropriate "Entity ID" to cross reference the two tables.

| Role Name | Applicable Interested Party | Entity ID | Description |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  --- |
| Drone Pilot | Private USS Operator | <b>B</b> | A pilot who is associated with a operator and has a drone and is trained and licensed to fly it. They may own multiple equipment.  |
| USS Administrator | USS Service provider |<b>B</b> |  A administrator within a USS, they can be the contact person between the regulator and USS. |
| Regulator Employee | ANSP or CAA | <b>A</b>,<b>B</b> | A regular employee in a regulator or ANSP who needs see flights and view data in the registry (but not authorize them). | --- |
| Regulator Manager | ANSP or CAA | <b>A</b>,<b>B</b> | A regular employee in a regulator or ANSP who needs to authorize flights and view data in the registry.  | May need unthrottled privileges |
| Law Enforcement "Standard" | Police | <b>D</b> | A regular employee in law enforcement at a local level (e.g. on patrol). | --- |
| Law Enforcement "Enhanced" | Police | <b>D</b> | A employee in law enforcement at a regional level (e.g. national investigation agency, head ). | May need unthrottled privileged |
